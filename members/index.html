                <b>ABOUT ME</b></br>
                Hello, I'm Jeremiah Milbauer. I grew up New York City, developing an early fondness for the big NYC specialties: art galleries, subways, bagels, pizza, crossword puzzles, and rats. Then I moved to the Windy City, where I studied computer science, philosophy, and linguistics at the University of Chicago. Currently, as an MLT student in the Language Technologies Institute, I do work to make knowledge representation more efficient and generalizable — in order to render AI more useful, in more ways, to more people.<br><br>Outside of work I enjoy playing music, telling stories, and — global health permitting — going out (and sometimes dancing) to jazz.

I am currently a graduate student in MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) program at LTI (class of 2022). I studied Telecommunications Engineering in University of Cantabria (Spain), and for the past four years I was working in the satellite communications industry, providing internet connectivity to yachts, cruises, and commercial vessels.<br><br>I decided to switch paths from networking to AI because of its potential to improve society for the better and its broad applicability. I am particularly interested in AI applications for social good that target regular people, like you and I. I am currently conducting research under Dr Kraut (professor emeritus of HCI) on Instagram and mental health. Academics apart, I love travelling, watching TV shows, and walking my dog (who I miss so very much because he’s in Spain).

                Hello! I am Mansi Goyal. I am currently pursuing an MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) program in LTI (class of 2021). I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Manipal Institute of Technology, India.  I then worked as a Software Development Engineer at Western Digital for two years.

Starting grad school remotely was a risky but rewarding decision. When I am not doing my assignments, I like to read and listen to music. I spend way too much time curating playlists on Spotify. I love volunteering and mentoring students! I also have vast experience in leading projects and diversity initiatives which include my own YouTube channel (<a href="https://medium.com/the-one-in-asankhya-project/about" target="_blank">https://medium.com/the-one-in-asankhya-project/about</a>)  that focuses on bringing successful people from different careers to share their journeys and struggles.

                <b>ABOUT ME</b></br>
                Hello all, my name is Parnal Sinha! I was born in Mumbai, India and my family currently resides in Houston, Texas. I earned my BS in Bioengineering: Biotechnology from the University of California, San Diego and graduated in June 2020 (straight into the pandemic). However, I was fortunate to find a position as a Research Assistant and then an Operations Technician at a startup medical device diagnostics company called Brevitest. Here, I was working in developing medical devices which perform traditional quantitative ELISAs for biomedical assays through an automated fashion. Specifically, our goal was to assist in curbing the COVID-19 health crisis by providing an efficient antibody test. My academic and research interests lie in computational modeling of proteomics & transcriptomics for systems-based analyses of cellular networks and regulatory pathways. Please feel free to contact me at: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parnal-sinha/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/in/parnal-sinha/</a> and/or <a href="mailto:ppsinha@andrew.cmu.edu">ppsinha@andrew.cmu.edu</a>!<br><br>I have a wide variety of interests due to my transient lifestyle during childhood. In fact, I moved constantly between South Korea, Malaysia, Dubai, and India over 5 years of my early childhood! Thereafter, my parents moved to Canada when I was 7 and left for Texas at 13 during my high school years and then finished my undergraduate program in California! I love to play soccer and have supported Arsenal for 16 years (pain). Furthermore, I have been focused on exercising and training over the past 3-4 years! I’m always willing to have different experiences such as hiking across mountainous trails, exploring attractions, dining at fusion cuisines and the occasional board game /movie night is always a blast! My music taste is very fluid (R&B, EDM, Pop, Soul, Alt, Lo-Fi, etc.); ironically not a big fan of country music. In terms of TV shows: I watch anything and everything, but I don’t have a good track record of finishing shows (Netflix, Hulu, Anime, etc.) Basically, I’m pretty easy to start a conversation with so I look forward to hearing from you soon!  :)

                Hi I'm Christophe Haddad! I am currently a MS in Computer Science student (graduating Dec 2022). I grew up in Lebanon, where I did my Bachelor's in Computer and Communications Engineering at the American University of Beirut. During my undergrad, I spent a summer semester at Stanford University, and a fall one at Ecole Polytechnique (France). I'm interested in knowledge representation and reasoning, logic, and psychology - at CMU, I'd like to contribute in making chatbots more useful and human friendly.

                Outside of work, I play piano (love to share the passion with friends), video games, love hiking, and enjoy fantasy/sci-fi movies.

                Hey! I am Pranav, a Masters student in the Machine Learning Department. I lived in India until I came to CMU in the fall of 2021. Now in Pittsburgh, I run, explore restaurants, and listen to music (trying to learn to play the guitar too). I get super excited about Chess, Tennis and Coffee. A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, I used to be an avid reader of books. Hopefully someday I will re-boot on that front. Currently at CMU, I am working on problems in distribution shift in Machine Learning at the ACMI Lab. I am always looking forward to the summer here! Happy to chat anytime about anything.

                Hi! I’m Kiran Prasad and I was born in Buffalo, NY. I’m currently studying AI in the MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) program in LT (class of 2021)I. I have particular interest in adversarial robustness, representations, and applications of AI to business problems. I did my undergrad at the University of Michigan where I studied Chemical Engineering and Computer Science (go blue!). If you’re interested in my professional profile please check out: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kpprasa" target="_blank">www.linkedin.com/in/kpprasa</a><br><br>I thoroughly enjoy learning about different fields having interest in physics, math, entrepreneurship, and philosophy (I’m way too into philosophy xD). To balance out all of that intellectual stuff, I really enjoy doing things outdoors (camping, biking, backpacking, swimming) and traveling (24 countries), yoga and meditation, and exploring (restaurants, bars, parks, cities, etc). Look forward to hearing from you!

                Hi! I am Romel Baral. I am a masters student in MSCB (Master of Science in Computational Biology) program; I expect to graduate in May, 2021. I was born in Kolkata, India. After finishing my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computing, I worked for Goldman Sachs for four years in algorithmic trading before joining CMU. My academic interests lie in application of Machine Learning in biological and financial data. Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romelbaral/" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/in/romelbaral/</a><br><br>I love to cook, travel and banter about politics, mythology, religion etc. I cook almost every day, mainly traditional dishes found in Indian subcontinent. I have special interest in peasant food across the world and I try to replicate them as closely as I am able to. I love to hike and love going on day trips. When I have time, I usually pick a hiking trail and walk for hours. I used to travel a lot while working, hopefully I regain that enthusiasm after my CMU years. I also love watching anime and tv shows (especially USA and british ones). Being a homosexual person, I felt the need of LGBTQ wellfare in India. I used to be quite involved in LGBTQ activism, and even took part in the Supreme Court case that amended colonial section 377 in favor of LGBTQ people. Looking forward to hearing from you!

                <b>ABOUT ME</b></br>
                Hey, I’m Evan Feder and I hail from Westport, CT. I’m in the Masters in Machine Learning program, graduating December 2021. I was previously an undergrad here at CMU, majoring in Information Systems + Statistics and Machine Learning. Throughout my time here at CMU I’ve done a few fun things, including TAed classes for the IS and ML departments, held multiple executive positions in Student Government, sat on too many university committees, served on the board of the CMU Business Technology Group, changed major plans twice, judged a chili cook-off, and threw the first pitch at a Pittsburgh Pirates game.<br><br>In my ample spare time I play the drums, jam out unironically to mid-2000s pop music, stare at my computer screen wondering why my code doesn’t work, rock climb, reminisce about when I used to actually remember my black belt-level kung fu, overanalyze the latest Christopher Nolan film, and annoy my friends with spontaneous pop culture references.

                <b>ABOUT ME</b></br>
                Hi this is Xinyu. I am an international student from China. I received my bachelor’s degree in Elementary and Special Education at University of Wisconsin - Madison and I am currently a first-year master’s student in METALS (Educational technology and applied learning science) at HCII. I am interested in instructional design and UX design and research, and I am passionate about exploring possible solutions for better educational outcomes.<br><br>I personally love doing sports and building Legos. I have a Lego collection at my apartment and I always bring them with me when I move. Usually I would like to go hiking with my friend during the weekends, and I have been to more than 10 trails in Pittsburgh.
